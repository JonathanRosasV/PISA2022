# PISA2022

# PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) is the program of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which measures the ability of 15-year-olds to use their knowledge and skills in reading, mathematics and science. It is applied every three years and seeks to know to what extent students are able to use the learning acquired in school to face situations and challenges of today's societies.

# The PISA test is applied in 83 countries on five continents and was suspended in 2021 due to the health emergency. Its objective is to determine the level of learning acquired by 15-year-old students from schools in urban and rural areas. The 2022 edition is the sixth participation of Peru, which, despite not being a member of the OECD, participates on a voluntary basis.
